# HTML Practice Repo ðŸŒ±

Welcome! This is my first GitHub repository where Iâ€™m practicing HTML.  
Each file in this repo is a small experiment with basic HTML elements as I learn frontend development.

---

## ðŸ“„ Files

- [`index.html`](index.html): A simple page with a heading and a paragraph
- [`jump-title.html`](jump-title.html): Internal navigation using anchor tags and IDs

(â€¦more files will be added as I learn!)

---

## ðŸ§  What I'm Learning

- Writing clean HTML structure
- Using tags like `<section>`, `<ol>`, `<a>`, and attributes like `id`, `class`, and `href`
- Creating links and basic navigation between sections

---

## ðŸ’¬ Thoughts

I'm new to HTML, but it's exciting to see real output from simple code.  
This repo will grow as I practice more topics.
